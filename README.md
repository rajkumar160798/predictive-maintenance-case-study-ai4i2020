# Predictive Maintenance Case Study: AI4I 2020 Dataset

This repository presents a real-world, end-to-end machine learning pipeline for predicting machine failures using multisensor time series data. Built for reliability, explainability, and industrial deployment, this project demonstrates how XGBoost and SHAP can power interpretable AI in manufacturing environments.

## Key Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis with 10+ visualizations
- Real failure mode analysis: HDF, TWF, OSF, etc.
- Predictive Modeling with XGBoost and RandomForest
- SHAP Explainability to uncover feature impact
- IEEE-Style Architecture Diagram (for paper & deployment)
- Research-ready paper draft targeting IEEE Access
